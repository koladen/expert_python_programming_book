LISTS

Let's define n as the length of a list. Here is a full table of average time complexities for
most of the list operations:
Operation Complexity
Copy O(n)
Append O(1)
Insert O(n)
Get item O(1)
Set item O(1)
Delete item O(n)
Iteration O(n)
Get slice of length k O(k)
Del slice O(n)
Set slice of length k O(k+n)
Extend O(k)
Multiply by k O(nk)
Test existence (element in list) O(n)
min()/max() O(n)
Get length O(1)

DICTS

Operation Average complexity Amortized worst case complexity
Get item O(1) O(n)
Set item O(1) O(n)
Delete item O(1) O(n)
Copy O(n) O(n)
Iteration O(n) O(n)
